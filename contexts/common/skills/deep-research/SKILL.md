# Deep Research

Produce thorough, cited research reports from multiple web sources using firecrawl and exa MCP tools.

## When to Activate

- User asks to research any topic in depth
- Competitive analysis, technology evaluation, or market sizing
- Due diligence on companies, investors, or technologies
- Any question requiring synthesis from multiple sources
- User says "research", "deep dive", "investigate", or "what's the current state of"

## MCP Requirements

At least one of:

- **firecrawl** — `firecrawl_search`, `firecrawl_scrape`, `firecrawl_crawl`
- **exa** — `web_search_exa`, `web_search_advanced_exa`, `crawling_exa`, `get_code_context_exa`

Both together give the best coverage. Configure in `~/.claude.json` or `~/.codex/config.toml`.

### Exa MCP Setup

```json
"exa-web-search": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "exa-mcp-server"],
  "env": { "EXA_API_KEY": "YOUR_EXA_API_KEY_HERE" }
}
```

**Key Exa tools:**

| Tool | Use for | Key params |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `web_search_exa` | Current news, company research, broad web | `query`, `numResults` (default 8), `category`, `livecrawl` |
| `web_search_advanced_exa` | Date-filtered or domain-scoped research | `startPublishedDate`, `numResults` |
| `get_code_context_exa` | Code examples, API docs, GitHub/SO | `query`, `tokensNum` (1000–50000, default 5000) |
| `crawling_exa` | Full-page deep read | `url`, `tokensNum` |

Use `get_code_context_exa` when you need implementation examples rather than general web pages. Lower `tokensNum` (1000–2000) for focused snippets, higher (5000+) for comprehensive context.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Goal

Ask 1-2 quick clarifying questions:

- "What's your goal — learning, making a decision, or writing something?"
- "Any specific angle or depth you want?"

If the user says "just research it" — skip ahead with reasonable defaults.

### Step 2: Plan the Research

Break the topic into 3-5 research sub-questions. Example:

- Topic: "Impact of AI on healthcare"
  - What are the main AI applications in healthcare today?
  - What clinical outcomes have been measured?
  - What are the regulatory challenges?
  - What companies are leading this space?
  - What's the market size and growth trajectory?

### Step 3: Execute Multi-Source Search

For EACH sub-question, search using available MCP tools:

**With firecrawl:**

```
firecrawl_search(query: "<sub-question keywords>", limit: 8)
```

**With exa:**

```
web_search_exa(query: "<sub-question keywords>", numResults: 8)
web_search_advanced_exa(query: "<keywords>", numResults: 5, startPublishedDate: "2025-01-01")
```

**Search strategy:**

- Use 2-3 different keyword variations per sub-question
- Mix general and news-focused queries
- Aim for 15-30 unique sources total
- Prioritize: academic, official, reputable news > blogs > forums

### Step 4: Deep-Read Key Sources

For the most promising URLs, fetch full content:

**With firecrawl:**

```
firecrawl_scrape(url: "<url>")
```

**With exa:**

```
crawling_exa(url: "<url>", tokensNum: 5000)
```

Read 3-5 key sources in full for depth. Do not rely only on search snippets.

### Step 5: Synthesize and Write Report

Structure the report:

```markdown
# [Topic]: Research Report

_Generated: [date] | Sources: [N] | Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]_

## Executive Summary

[3-5 sentence overview of key findings]

## 1. [First Major Theme]

[Findings with inline citations]

- Key point ([Source Name](url))
- Supporting data ([Source Name](url))

## 2. [Second Major Theme]

...

## 3. [Third Major Theme]

...

## Key Takeaways

- [Actionable insight 1]
- [Actionable insight 2]
- [Actionable insight 3]

## Sources

1. [Title](url) — [one-line summary]
2. ...

## Methodology

Searched [N] queries across web and news. Analyzed [M] sources.
Sub-questions investigated: [list]
```

### Step 6: Deliver

- **Short topics**: Post the full report in chat
- **Long reports**: Post the executive summary + key takeaways, save full report to a file

## Parallel Research with Subagents

For broad topics, use Claude Code's Task tool to parallelize:

```
Launch 3 research agents in parallel:
1. Agent 1: Research sub-questions 1-2
2. Agent 2: Research sub-questions 3-4
3. Agent 3: Research sub-question 5 + cross-cutting themes
```

Each agent searches, reads sources, and returns findings. The main session synthesizes into the final report.

## Quality Rules

1. **Every claim needs a source.** No unsourced assertions.
2. **Cross-reference.** If only one source says it, flag it as unverified.
3. **Recency matters.** Prefer sources from the last 12 months.
4. **Acknowledge gaps.** If you couldn't find good info on a sub-question, say so.
5. **No hallucination.** If you don't know, say "insufficient data found."
6. **Separate fact from inference.** Label estimates, projections, and opinions clearly.

## Examples

```
"Research the current state of nuclear fusion energy"
"Deep dive into Rust vs Go for backend services in 2026"
"Research the best strategies for bootstrapping a SaaS business"
"What's happening with the US housing market right now?"
"Investigate the competitive landscape for AI code editors"
```
